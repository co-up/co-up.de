  Space instructions
</h1>

Welcome to co.up! Below you will find basic instructions on how to use the space. Please note that our [Code of Conduct](https://co-up.de/code-of-conduct/) and [Hygiene Guidelines](https://co-up.de/hygiene-safety-guidelines/) also apply. Our space has a “2G” (vaccinated or recovered from covid-19) requirement, which we ask you to respect and enforce during your visit (2G + proof of booster or negative test result for events).

### Finding the space
As the space is currently a bit harder to find, please follow the instructions on how to find us here: http://co-up.de/about.html#location. Tell your guests to ring at "co.up" (3d floor).

### Wifi
In order to access the Internet, connect to "co.up" with the password: clubmate. Open a browser to any page.

### Equipment
Feel free to make use of whatever equipment in the space you would like to & rearrange the furniture according to your needs.

The projector and speakers in the event space are both plugged into the power strip behind the curtain. The beamer projects onto the wall and can be used via HDMI. We have adapters on site, but recommend bringing your own just in case.
The speakers can be used via an audio jack. We also have a couple different microphones on-site (but the acoustics of the room are good enough to not need one).

Please note that rental of the event space does not include use of the meeting room, unless specifically arranged in advance. In the same way, rental of the meeting room excludes use of the event space, coworking desks and lounge area.

After your booking, please return the space in the state you found it in and treat it as a leave-no-trace campsite: if you brought it in, bring it out. Dirty dishes go in the dishwasher; if it is full, please toss in a soap tab & turn it on. Please also make sure the coffee machine is clean before you leave; in particular, rinse out the plastic tube for the milk foamer by running it under the faucet and do not leave any milk in the machine's drip tray. If needed, cleaning supplies, toilet paper & trash bags can be found in the bathroom to the left.


### Drinks, snacks & supporting the space

Drinks can be found in the event space refrigerator and cost 2€ a piece. Paying for the drinks is based on a trust system: you can either leave cash in the white bowl next to the fridge, or pay via the PayPal QR code posted on the fridge, or get in touch with us to add them to your invoice. You can also pay for the snacks in the kitchen this way. Empty bottles should be put in the matching crates.

We would highly appreciate it if you let your participants know that they can sign up for a support membership or a coworking membership by going to members.co-up.de, and that they can also make a one-time donation via PayPal or Ko-Fi at [co-up.de/support-us](http://co-up.de/support-us).

Tagging us on social media also goes a long way: you can find us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/co_up), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/co_up_de) and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/co.up.community/). Thank you kindly!


### Elevator/Accessibility

For wheelchair users & people with special accessibility needs, the elevator key (with a round head) is attached to the pink plush elephant in the kitchen. The key is necessary to open the elevator door from the outside on the ground floor, as well as to choose a floor: there is a slot on the control panel for the key to be placed in & turned. Please make sure to return the elephant to its spot when you’ve finished using it.

Unfortunately the building managers denied our request to rebuild the bathrooms to be accessible, so the closest such bathrooms are in the Mittelpunktbibliothek (Adalbertstr. 2), the bar Möbel Olfe (Reichenberger Str. 177) and the bar Südblock (Admiralstr. 1-2): http://wheelmap.org/map#/


### Leaving/Key return
 
If you are running an event outside of office hours, be absolutely sure that you are the last person leaving, since participants might get locked in the space/courtyard! After locking the door, exit the building & go left to the small gate at Adalbertstr. 5-6.

If you do not have your own set of keys to the space, keys are to be picked up and returned in person with a member of co.up or Kiez Büro staff; if there is an issue, please get in touch with us ASAP.

Thanks very much for your courtesy & understanding! co.up is happy to support you & your project. We look forward to hosting you!
