Hi there,

I have some big news to share. Coworking will be part of co.up's mission again!

There is more. After the [big success of our #saveCoUp campaign](https://co-up.de/2020/01/06/2020-co-up-reborn/), corona hit, and [all plans were put on hold](https://co-up.de/2020/03/12/coup-temporarily-closed/) :(. 1.5 years later co.up is still here, carried through the crisis by you, the steadfast supporters of co.up!

We didn't want to let co.up lay dormant any longer, but I have to admit that neither I nor Alex could find the resources to properly wake it up. So I took the next logical step and started looking for someone who can. The first person that came to mind to approach was Björn. Björn is co-founder and owner of [Kiez Büro](https://www.kiez-buero.de), and I have known him for over 4 years through his initiative in the Berlin Coworking Meetup. Björn has grown Kiez Büro to 14 coworking locations that are true to their name, and as of October 2021 co.up is part of that network.

Björn and Kiez Büro fully embrace co.up’s mission to be an affordable event and workspace in the heart of Kreuzberg that supports representation and accessibility in tech. The change of ownership will have no impact on memberships or events. Claire will be staying on as space manager and help to carry co.up’s mission forward. You can keep using existing channels of contact and we are all working together for a smooth transition.

I'm happy that we are bringing coworking back now with the whole network of Kiez Büro spaces, so that events can draw from a bigger audience and at the same time coworkers will have more options—e.g. working at co.up to attend an event or somewhere closer to home in a Kiez-Büro. We are confident that co.up is in good hands for a bright future.

If you have questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to [us](mailto:hello@co-up.de), [Claire](mailto:claire@co-up.de), [Björn](mailto:bjoern@kiez-buero.de) or [me](mailto:thilo@co-up.de).

Happy Coworking!
Thilo
