  If your event is educational (ie. knowledge-sharing, peer-to-peer tutoring, self-organized learning groups, etc.), open to everyone, and does not have an entrance fee, we are happy to support you by letting you use the space for free. As an organizer we need you to read and abide by the space instructions, as well as make sure everyone participating in your event follows our <a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.
