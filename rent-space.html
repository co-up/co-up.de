<h2>Host your event in a living piece of Berlin's tech history</h2>

<p>
  co.up's story goes back to the early days of Berlin's tech scene, when it was one of the first coworking spaces forging a new way to work by bridging the gap between professionals from the creative and tech worlds; today it's also a community space that continues a tradition of supporting and serving underrepresented communities in tech. Our meeting room seats 12 people and is available for external bookings, which helps us to continue our mission to make the tech industry more representative. Contact <a href="mailto:hello@co-up.de">hello@co-up.de</a> to check our availability!
