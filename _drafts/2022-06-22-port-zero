An interview with: Port Zero
</h1>

It's now been over two and a half years since the [#savecoup](https://co-up.de/2019/11/06/save-co-up/) campaign, which at the time appeared to be the biggest challenge co.up would ever face. One pandemic onset later, we're still here and in an [exciting new phase](https://co-up.de/2021/10/19/coworking-is-back/) as part of the Kiez Büro network - but this wouldn't be possible without ongoing support from companies such as our friends from Port Zero! We sat down (in a manner of speaking) with CEO Michael Prinzinger to chat about the company, our shared history, and more. Read on!

**Hello Michael! Tell us a little about yourself. What do you do at Port Zero?**<br/>
Hello! I am the founder and managing director of Port Zero. We talk about ourselves as a crew on a ship. So I see myself as the ship's captain. I check that we are heading in a good direction, that everybody on board has what they need to work, can learn and grow as a professional sailor and person, and that our ship's missions (supporting clients at sea) are successful.

I got into computers early on, when my parents gifted me a used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a> — so my path to studying computer science was set for me. At the end, however, I realized that what I love more is bringing the right people to the right project, and I gradually shifted to organizing teams and projects. Before starting Port Zero, I was project lead at a big corporation. When I quit there, I wanted to build a work environment where people are heard, their ideas are valued, and they can be themselves (as in wonderful non-perfect human beings with emotions, bad days, making mistakes, etc.). To be honest, I selfishly wanted to build an environment of people where I myself would want to work.

**What does Port Zero do? How did you get your start?**
Our ship goes on missions to explore new unknown realms and support other ships at sea. In non-nautical terms, we support organizations in three fields: IT Security (e.g. pentests or incident response), Integration (e.g. integrating open source solutions into existing organizational infrastructure) and Software Development (mainly in Python, React and Haskell).

There's a cool story behind how we got started. It was 2013 and Edward Snowden had just disclosed how the NSA was systematically spying on everybody. Back then everybody was talking about how to protect oneself against that. While there were already a lot of tools available, we found that for instance email encryption, while having existed for a long time, was too complicated and unwieldy for ordinary people to use. Thus we came up with a pretty cool technical solution that didn’t compromise in terms of security, while also being super easy and comfortable to use. We called the product <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kinko-me-pretty-easy-privacy#/">kinko.me</a>.

While the idea and technology were great, and we received lots of positive feedback from the community, science and the press, in the end a crowdfunding campaign showed us that even after Snowden, nobody was willing to spend money on email encryption. By then it was the end of 2014 and we had to admit that it didn't work out financially. However, seeing that we had a great team and had received so much good feedback, I decided to move on with Port Zero, but in a new direction: as a consultancy supporting other organizations in their projects. And that's what we have been doing ever since—and we now have 9 years of exciting projects to look back upon!

**You’re based in Berlin, like us! What do you think?**
Yep, and close by in Kreuzberg too! Berlin is great. People here are open-minded and forward-looking. There is such great food in the city and I love Berlin’s multicultural melting pot. On the other hand, Berlin is dirty and smelly, or in the fitting words of The Incredible Herrengedeck: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFJrjjDHRJE">Berlin stinks!</a> ;p

**How do you know co.up?**
Well that's where we started! Before we got an office of our own, for many years the co.up coworking space was our HQ and meeting point. So many memories with that place—most of the video footage we shot for kinko.me back in the day even shows a blurry co.up in the background. And it's great to see how co.up, parallel to Port Zero, also evolved over time and just like us overcame many challenges!

**What made Port Zero decide to become a company supporter of co.up?**
For one: our long shared history, and the fact that our starting point was there. We haven’t forgotten how co.up supported us in the beginning. But more importantly, since we’ve known co.up, they've supported the Berlin community by providing a great meeting space for initiatives, learning groups, meetups, conferences and much much more, and all of that free of charge. It's such a wonderful and important community service that it was clear we had to support co.up when the space was in danger [when we had to raise funds in 2019 to meet a 100% increase in our rent -  Ed.]

**Do you have a favorite story you’d like to share with us about co.up, community events and/or coworking?**
Oh my, yes, although it’s a pretty embarrassing one. Speaking of memories, there was a day where we (Port Zero) were amongst ourselves on the third floor, and just nothing was working that day and request after request was coming in. At some point it got to be too much for me, and I kicked a chair and yelled... Later on the fifth floor, somebody from the co.up staff wanted to talk to me about the fact that I needed to have better control over my team and should have a serious talk with them, because somebody had caused such a big ruckus that people upstairs could hear. Grimacing, I promised to talk to "them".

**If you could be a venue in Berlin, which one would you be and why?**
If I could, I would open a venue that is part office, part café, part community event space and part maker lab / hackspace. The office would have a closed-off part for Port Zero and an open part for friends, and the rest would be open as well. In today’s world I strongly believe that in cooperating with others, knowledge exchange, supporting each other and learning from each others are the pillars for being a business. At the same time, I also believe a business should support the local community it is part of. I see both things beautifully realized with a venue like this.

**Is there anything else you’d like to share?**
Not gonna let this opportunity to share wisdom slide, so here it goes: never give up, and believe in yourself and humanity. Both can sometimes be difficult, especially in current times. But it is a choice we can make, and with that choice, you’ll see failure as an important learning step along the way, and start seeing that everybody in their own capacity tries their best to do good in this world. The best is to put your focus and perspective on the good, while not closing your eyes to the bad. Doing that with an attitude of gratefulness, I believe, will step by step lead to a world we’d all like to live in. And the great thing is that, by doing that for yourself and the ones close to you, you will build and live in that world now.

**Thanks for your time!**
It was my pleasure!
