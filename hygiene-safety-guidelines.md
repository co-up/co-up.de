  Hygiene & safety guidelines
</h1>
 
*updated on July 22, 2021* 

In light of the current public health situation, the following regulations are in place at co.up:

**Maximum occupancy**<br/>
Maximum occupancy at co.up is currently 12 people for all in-person events. This includes guests, speakers and organizers.
We ask that organizers make sure to limit signups accordingly. In order to add to the accessibility of their events, we also encourage them to offer them in a hybrid format (IRL + streaming) when possible.

**Hygiene concept and enforcement**<br/>
Organizers must prepare a personalized hygiene concept for their event and are solely responsible for posting it, enforcing it, and submitting it to local health authorities upon request. This concept must follow the guidelines listed in Berlin's [Dritte SARS-CoV-2-Infektionsschutzmaßnahmenverordnung](https://www.berlin.de/corona/massnahmen/verordnung/), §5. Organizers can use our guidelines text as a basis for their hygiene concept; their own concept must be aligned with co.up's.

**Contact tracing and documentation**<br/>
Each person present in the space during an event must provide the following information: first and last name, phone number, district or city of residence, e-mail address (if available), full residential address (if available), times of attendance and their seat or table number (if applicable). Organizers are required to collect this information, to store it securely for four weeks, and to provide it to local health authorities upon request.

**Proof of vaccination, recovery, or negative test result**<br/>
As of July 6, 2021, only guests at events of 50 people and up are legally required to provide certification of either a negative test result, full vaccination, or recovery from covid-19. This is therefore currently not mandatory for events at co.up. We do, however, encourage attendees and organizers to make use of Berlin's free antigen testing offer on the day of their event. Guests presenting any cold-like symptoms, and/or an impacted sense of taste or smell, on the day of the event are not allowed to enter the space.

**Masks**<br/>
FFP2 masks are mandatory for everyone in the space at all times, including when you are seated and with the exception of performing or presenting. This mandate applies to the entirety of the event space, the kitchen and the restrooms. Our landlord also mandates wearing a medicinal mask on the entirety of the building premises (i.e. the stairwell, the elevator, and the courtyards and parking lots).

**Social distancing**<br/>
All occupants of the space must maintain a 1.5m distance with each other at all times. During in-person meetups, attendees must be sitting down. Seats must be placed at a minimum of 1.5m from each other.

**Ventilation**<br/>
Please ventilate the space as much as possible by keeping the windows open all the way. The space must be ventilated at least every hour for 5-10 minutes, even in colder weather.

**Other hygiene rules**<br/>
Occupants must respect sneeze-and-cough etiquette (into your elbow, not your hand) and wash their hands thoroughly after touching shared surfaces. Disinfect all shared surfaces frequently using the disinfectant wipes available in the kitchen. Please do not share food or drinks.

**Limits to space use**<br/>
The meeting room is reserved for Lumeo and Cobot staff, and may not be used for other events unless agreed upon beforehand with co.up management.
Please refrain from making use of the kitchen facilities. The Cobot offices on the 5th floor remain closed to all events.

The covid-19 pandemic continues to be a dynamically changing situation. We reserve the right to close co.up to the public at any time we deem necessary to help curb a rise in coronavirus infections, regardless of local or federal regulations concerning events and gatherings. Organizers of booked events will be given 48h notice by email when this is the case.

Furthermore, we reserve the right to revoke organizers' access to the space if the above hygiene and safety protocols are not enforced. This can take place on very short notice (i.e. <48h before the next scheduled event).
