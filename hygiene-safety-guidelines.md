  Hygiene & safety guidelines
</h1>

_Last updated July 4, 2022_

In light of the current public health situation, the following rules are in place at co.up:

**Proof of vaccination or recovery requirement (“2G”)**<br/>
co.up is a “2G” space as defined by German regulations (“vaccinated/recovered”). All users of the space must be able to provide valid proof of vaccination against, or recovery from, covid-19 when asked.

As an additional measure, we recommend taking a rapid antigenic test before coming to the space, regardless of vaccination or recovery status.

**Events**<br/>
There is an additional “2G+” rule for events at co.up (proof of vaccination/recovery AND either a same-day negative test result or proof of a booster). Event organizers are responsible for enforcing this rule.

The maximum occupancy for in-person events at co.up is currently 50 people, including organizers and speakers.

We strongly encourage event organizers to make use of the [Corona-Warn-App’s QR code check-in feature](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/eventregistration/), and to increase the accessibility of their event by taking advantage of our high-speed internet for streaming.

**Masking**<br/>
When coworking, please wear a mask (FFP2/KN95) whenever you are not at your seat.<br/>
During events, wearing a mask is strongly encouraged.

**Ventilation**<br/>
Please ventilate the space as much as possible; we recommend at least once every hour, by opening the windows all the way.

**Other hygiene rules**<br/>
In general, please be mindful of others in the space! We ask that you not come in to the space if you feel sick. Sneeze and cough into your elbow instead of your hand, and wash your hands frequently and thoroughly. Disinfectant wipes are available for wiping down shared surfaces. Please do not share food or drinks. Respect social distancing with others as much as possible.

We reserve the right to revoke organizers’ access to the space if hygiene and safety protocols are not enforced.
