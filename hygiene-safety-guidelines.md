  Hygiene & safety guidelines
</h1>
 
*Last updated January 4, 2022*

In light of the current public health situation, the following regulations are in place at co.up *(scroll down for the tl;dr)*:

**Proof of vaccination or recovery requirement (“2G”)** <br/>
Access to co.up for any person, including but not limited to co.up staff and contractors, coworking members, office tenants, event organizers and event attendees, is only allowed after having shown proof of full vaccination against covid-19 OR of recovery from covid-19, AND a valid form of photo ID, either to a member of co.up staff, Kiez Büro staff, or (when attending an event) to the event organizer. co.up staff, contractors, coworking members, tenants and event organizers must arrange for an in-person appointment with a member of Kiez Büro or co.up staff to show this proof, following which they may continue to use the space normally.

- Proof of vaccination or of recovery must be a digital certificate stored in the Robert Koch Institute's [CovPass](https://digitaler-impfnachweis-app.de/) app. Other forms of certification will not be accepted.

- The proof of vaccination or recovery QR code must be scanned by a member of co.up or Kiez Büro staff (or an organizer during events) using the RKI's [CovPassCheck](https://digitaler-impfnachweis-app.de/covpasscheck-app/) app. They must also verify that the name and date of birth on the scanned certificate match the name and date of birth on the ID provided.
  
- Failure to provide either an acceptable proof of vaccination or recovery or a valid photo ID will result in exclusion from the premises until such time as the person can provide them. Event organizers are informed that failure to properly verify proof of vaccination or recovery and ID may result in a permanent ban from the space.

As an additional measure to help curb the spread of the virus, we strongly recommend that event organizers enforce a same-day negative test result requirement (“2G+”) along with the above requirements.    

**Maximum occupancy for events** <br/>
The maximum occupancy for in-person events at co.up is currently 20 people, including organizers and speakers. We encourage organizers to increase the accessibility of their event by offering a hybrid option.
  
**Hygiene concept and enforcement** <br/>
Event organizers are solely responsible for preparing a personalized hygiene concept for their event, posting it, enforcing it, and submitting it to local health authorities upon request. This concept must follow the guidelines listed in Berlin’s [Vierte SARS-CoV-2-Infektionsschutzmaßnahmenverordnung](https://www.berlin.de/corona/massnahmen/verordnung/). Organizers can use our guidelines text as a basis for their hygiene concept; their own concept must be aligned with co.up’s.

**Contact tracing and documentation** <br/>
Each person present in the space during an event must provide the following information: first and last name, phone number, district or city of residence, e-mail address or full residential address, times of attendance and their seat or table number (if applicable). Organizers are solely responsible for collecting this information, storing it securely for four weeks, and providing it to local health authorities upon request.

**Masking** <br/>
Wearing an FFP2 mask inside the space is strongly recommended. Outside of co.up, wearing a medicinal mask is mandatory on the entirety of the building premises.

**Social distancing** <br/>
We strongly recommend keeping a minimum distance of 1.5 meters between members of different households as much as possible.

**Ventilation** <br/>
Please ventilate the space as much as possible by opening the windows all the way. The space must be ventilated at least every hour for 5-10 minutes, even in colder weather.

**Other hygiene rules** <br/>
Occupants must respect sneeze-and-cough etiquette (into your elbow, not your hand) and wash their hands thoroughly after touching shared surfaces. Disinfect all shared surfaces frequently using the disinfectant wipes available in the kitchen. Please do not share food or drinks.

**Limits to space use** <br/>
The meeting room is reserved for co.up staff and coworkers, Lumeo staff and Kiez Büro staff, and may not be used for other events unless agreed upon beforehand with co.up management. 

The covid-19 pandemic continues to be a dynamically changing situation. We reserve the right to close co.up to the public at any time we deem necessary to help curb a rise in coronavirus infections, regardless of local or federal regulations concerning events and gatherings. Organizers of booked events will be given 48h notice by email when this is the case.

Furthermore, we reserve the right to revoke organizers’ access to the space if the above hygiene and safety protocols are not enforced. This can take place on very short notice (i.e. <48h before the next scheduled event).

**tl;dr** <br/>
- co.up is a 2G space. People must show a CovPass digital certificate of vaccination OR recovery AND a valid photo ID to a member of co.up or Kiez Büro staff (or to an organizer if attending an event) before they can use the space. Failure to do so will lead to an exclusion from the premises until both documents can be provided.
- Digital certificates must be scanned for validity by a member of co.up or Kiez Büro staff or an event organizer using the CovPassCheck app. They must also check that the name and date of birth on the certificate match those on the ID provided. Event organizers who fail to verify both documents risk a permanent ban from the space.
- For events, maximum capacity for events is 20 people; wearing an FFP2 mask and maintaining a distance of 1.5m with members of other households is strongly encouraged; the space must be ventilated for 5-10 minutes every hour, even in cold weather. 
- Contact tracing documentation is the sole responsibility of event organizers, as well as creating and providing a hygiene concept for their event to local health authorities.
- We strongly recommend that event organizers add a same-day negative test requirement to their event (“2G+”).
