  Hygiene & safety guidelines
</h1>
 
*Last updated February 8, 2022*

In light of the current public health situation, the following regulations are in place at co.up *(scroll down for the tl;dr)*:

**Proof of vaccination or recovery requirement (“2G”)** <br/>
Access to co.up for any person, including but not limited to co.up staff and contractors, coworking members, office tenants, event organizers and event attendees, is only allowed after having shown proof of full vaccination against covid-19 OR of recovery from covid-19, AND a valid form of photo ID, either to a member of co.up staff, Kiez Büro staff, or (when attending an event) to the event organizer. co.up staff, contractors, coworking members, tenants and event organizers must arrange for an in-person appointment with a member of Kiez Büro or co.up staff to show this proof, following which they may continue to use the space normally.
- Proof of vaccination or of recovery must be a digital certificate stored in the Robert Koch Institute's [CovPass](https://digitaler-impfnachweis-app.de/) app. Other forms of certification will not be accepted.
- The proof of vaccination or recovery QR code must be scanned by a member of co.up or Kiez Büro staff (or an organizer during events) using the RKI's [CovPassCheck](https://digitaler-impfnachweis-app.de/covpasscheck-app/) app. They must also verify that the name and date of birth on the scanned certificate match the name and date of birth on the ID provided. In the event of a booster requirement (see below), they must also ask the person to show proof of their booster dose via this certificate.
- Failure to provide either an acceptable proof of vaccination or recovery or a valid photo ID will result in exclusion from the premises until such time as the person can provide them. Event organizers are informed that failure to properly verify proof of vaccination or recovery and ID may result in a permanent ban from the space.

As an additional measure to help curb the spread of the virus, we recommend taking a rapid antigenic test (either at a Point of Care location or self-administered) before entering the space for the day, regardless of vaccination or recovery status.

**Additional testing requirement for events ("2G+")**<br/>
Event organizers must both respect and enforce a same-day negative test result requirement, regardless of the number of attendees:
- Event attendees must provide a same-day negative rapid antigenic test result before entering the space.
- Event attendees who have received a booster dose of a covid-19 vaccine up to 3 months prior to the event are not required to provide a negative test result, and must instead provide digital proof that they have received this booster dose. However, we do encourage all attendees to get tested even if they are boosted.
- Testing requirements and exemptions also apply to event organizers.
- We encourage attendees and organizers to get tested as close to the beginning of the event as possible.

**Maximum occupancy for events** <br/>
The maximum occupancy for in-person events at co.up is currently 20 people, including organizers and speakers. We encourage organizers to increase the accessibility of their event by offering a hybrid option.
  
**Hygiene concept and enforcement** <br/>
Event organizers are solely responsible for preparing a personalized hygiene concept for their event, posting it, enforcing it, and submitting it to local health authorities upon request. This concept must follow the guidelines listed in Berlin’s [Vierte SARS-CoV-2-Infektionsschutzmaßnahmenverordnung](https://www.berlin.de/corona/massnahmen/verordnung/). Organizers can use our guidelines text as a basis for their hygiene concept; their own concept must be aligned with co.up’s.

**Contact tracing and documentation** <br/>
Contact tracing documentation is not required for events; we do however strongly encourage event organizers to make use of the [Corona-Warn-App’s QR code check-in feature](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/eventregistration/).

**Masking** <br/>
Wearing an FFP2/KN95 mask is mandatory inside the space when you are not at your seat. During events, wearing an FFP2/KN95 is mandatory for attendees at all times. Outside of co.up, masking is mandatory on the entirety of the building premises.

**Social distancing** <br/>
We strongly recommend keeping a minimum distance of 1.5 meters between members of different households as much as possible.

**Ventilation** <br/>
Please ventilate the space as much as possible by opening the windows all the way. The space must be ventilated at least every hour for 5-10 minutes, even in colder weather.

**Other hygiene rules** <br/>
Occupants must respect sneeze-and-cough etiquette (into your elbow, not your hand) and wash their hands thoroughly after touching shared surfaces. Disinfect all shared surfaces frequently using the disinfectant wipes available in the kitchen. Please do not share food or drinks.

**Limits to space use** <br/>
The meeting room is reserved for co.up staff and coworkers, office tenants, and Kiez Büro staff, and may not be used for other events unless agreed upon beforehand with co.up management. 

The covid-19 pandemic continues to be a dynamically changing situation. We reserve the right to close co.up to the public at any time we deem necessary to help curb a rise in coronavirus infections, regardless of local or federal regulations concerning events and gatherings. Organizers of booked events will be given 48h notice by email when this is the case.

Furthermore, we reserve the right to revoke organizers’ access to the space if the above hygiene and safety protocols are not enforced. This can take place on very short notice (i.e. <48h before the next scheduled event).

**tl;dr** <br/>
- co.up is a 2G space. People must show a CovPass digital certificate of vaccination OR recovery AND a valid photo ID to a member of co.up or Kiez Büro staff (or to an organizer if attending an event) before they can use the space. Failure to do so will lead to an exclusion from the premises until both documents can be provided.
- Digital certificates must be scanned for validity by a member of co.up or Kiez Büro staff or an event organizer using the CovPassCheck app. They must also check that the name and date of birth on the certificate match those on the ID provided, and in the event of a booster requirement, verify that the certificate shows the person has received a booster dose within the last 3 months. Event organizers who fail to verify both documents risk a permanent ban from the space.
- Maximum capacity for events is 20 people; a same-day negative antigenic rapid test result is required for attendees and organizers of events of any size, except for boosted attendees and organizers, who must show proof thereof; contact tracing documentation is not required for events, but we encourage use of the Corona-Warn-App check-in feature.
- Wearing an FFP2/KN95 mask is mandatory unless you are at your seat and is mandatory for event attendees at all times; maintaining a distance of 1.5m with members of other households is strongly encouraged; the space must be ventilated for 5-10 minutes every hour, even in cold weather.
