<h1>
  Cowork at co.up!
</h1>

co.up began as one of the very first coworking spaces to open in Berlin, at the heart of Kreuzberg 36 on the U8 line. After focusing on community events for four years, we are very happy to once again offer coworking!

We’re located on the third floor of a classic Berlin factory building, in direct proximity to Kottbusser Tor and surrounded by a wide range of restaurants and cafés. You’ll find us by entering the wooden passageway currently located at Adalbertstr. 5-6, walking under the first overpass into the first courtyard, turning left into the second courtyard and heading past the bike racks to the door facing the mailboxes on the left. Ring at co.up to be buzzed in!

Our 155 sqm open space area offers plenty of room for coworking, with large flex and fixed desks, comfortable office chairs, and plenty of natural light. Our 15 sqm meeting room can host up to 8 people for smaller meetings and includes a whiteboard. Both areas are connected to our high-speed WiFi. Like our meeting room, our phone booth is available on a first-come, first-serve basis and can also be booked in advance, just like the meeting room.

Coworking memberships include use of the kitchen, equipped with a microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher and various means of making coffee and tea. All memberships also include access to the co.up Slack and use of our B/W printer and scanner (up to 100 printed pages per month). We offer a selection of soft drinks and water for 2€ each, as well as coffee, tea and milk for free.

Our all-gender restrooms are unfortunately not wheelchair-accessible, but there are several accessible restrooms located nearby at [Möbel Olfe](https://wheelmap.org/nodes/616308956), the [Liebknecht/Kemal-Bibliothek](https://wheelmap.org/nodes/-37739166) and [Südblock](https://wheelmap.org/nodes/-65425822). Our industrial-size elevator requires a key to operate - please let us know if you need to use it!
