<h1>
  Cowork at co.up!
</h1>

co.up began as one of the very first coworking spaces to open in Berlin, at the heart of Kreuzberg 36 on the U8 line. After focusing on community events for four years, we are very happy to once again offer coworking!

We’re located on the third floor of a classic Berlin factory building, in direct proximity to Kottbusser Tor and surrounded by a wide range of restaurants and cafés. You’ll find us by entering the wooden passageway currently located at Adalbertstr. 5-6, walking under the first overpass into the first courtyard, turning left into the second courtyard and heading past the bike racks to the door facing the mailboxes on the left. Ring at co.up to be buzzed in!

We offer a 155 sqm open space area for coworking, with 8 large desks and 4 desks with adjustable height, and plenty of natural light, as well as a 15sqm room for quiet coworking that features 5 desks with adjustable height. Our large meeting room can host 16-20 people for smaller meetings and includes a whiteboard, a flipchart and a TV screen. Both areas are connected to our high-speed WiFi. Like our meeting room, our phone booth is available on a first-come, first-serve basis and can also be booked in advance, just like the meeting room.

Coworking memberships include use of the kitchen, equipped with a microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher and various means of making coffee and tea. All memberships also include access to the co.up Slack and use of our B/W printer and scanner (up to 100 printed pages per month). We offer a selection of soft drinks and water for 2€ each, as well as coffee, tea and milk for free.

Our all-gender restrooms are unfortunately not wheelchair-accessible, but there are several accessible restrooms located nearby at [Möbel Olfe](https://wheelmap.org/nodes/616308956), the [Liebknecht/Kemal-Bibliothek](https://wheelmap.org/nodes/-37739166) and [Südblock](https://wheelmap.org/nodes/-65425822). Our industrial-size elevator requires a key to operate - please let us know if you need to use it!
